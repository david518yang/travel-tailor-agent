Comments:
---------

problem 4.2, critical path should be 'G', 'D', 'E', 'M', and 'Q'.  This gives
   a total of 32 days.  Your path ending at 'R' only has a total of 30 days
   so is not the 'critical' path.  Further, there is no path through this
   graph that connects task 'K' with task 'N' so this sequence isn't a path.

problem 4.4, this is not a Gantt chart.  It does show the start and end time
   for each task, but a Gantt chart shows a lot more than this.  The finish
   date for the project should be Feb 18th, not Mar 6th.

On problem 5.3, there are a couple of your answers which are inconsistent
   with the book's answers.  It should be:
      B, U&F, U&F, U&F, N, N, N, N, N, F, F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F
   pretty close, though...


I can't evaluate what isn't there.  Sorry.
